        <p> My Alma mater, is <strong><a href="https://www.xiss.ac.in/">

            <em><a download href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=11UFnx4rUo5G8JJRBhRs_TlsR3xDyt_nz">
            Chaze Balance</a></em>, I spearheaded the development of a full
            blown <strong>ERP</strong> software and have consulted
            <strong><a href="https://www.ibm.com/in-en">IBM</a></strong>
            on over 338 software projects, ranging from tool design to data
            analytics.
            <br />
            I have worked, briefly with <strong><a href="https://www.tatasteel.com/">
            Tata Iron and Steel Company</a></strong>, where I implemented the
            <em><a href="http://automationtatasteel.com/html/slab_autograding_system.html">
            Automated Caster Parameter Tracking System</a></em>, which automated
            the process of capturing composition of molten steel that would be
            cast into steel slabs.
            Also, I have assisted the
            <strong><a href="https://jharkhandhighcourt.nic.in">Honorable High
            Court of Jharkhand</a></strong> in my capacity as
            <em>Court Manager (Officer)</em>,wherein I was responsible for
            administering a strength of over 300 employees, with regard to
            general management and court functioning. It was also expectant of me
            in this role, to collate data on all aspects of court functioning as
            well as run a digitization drive of the courts and report it to the
            Honorable Jharkhand High Court.
            I also oversaw the building and inaugration of the new court complex
            at Tenughat, Jharkhand during my tenure, which became functional in
            early 2014.
            <br />
            In my free time, I like to read books - fiction as well as
            non fiction, catch up on the latest gaming action on the
            <strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-in/explore/ps4/">PS4
            </a></strong> platform and I am an avid swimmer and pool
            player.
            <br />
            Also, I love exploring advanced areas of applied mathematics and
            computer science, to up my skills and discover the latest innovations
            in software development.

                        for the Slab Casting division.
                        Automated Caster Parameter Tracking System (ACPTS) under functional head
                        Ms. Mita Upadhyay.

                        <br />
                        <ul>Key Responsibilites:
                            <ul>Fact-finding and need analysis:
                                <li>Identified and assimilated the information needs for the steel casting division (SMPL).
                                    Fact finding and need capturing was done through brief questionnaires,
                                    personal interviews and interactive sessions with the sectional heads.</li>
                                <li>Industry knowledge, best practices and key processes identification was conducted.</li>
                                <li>The manual process consisted of 8 terminals with marquees reporting the composition
                                    of the real time castings which was noted down by 12 individuals per shift on a manual 2 feet by 2 feet sized
                                    HEAT LOG sheet, making the process cumbersome and error prone and more specifically prone to errors of omission,
                                    due to the manual nature of logging the composition.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>Implementation:
                                <li>The filled questionnaires, personal interviews and interactions with key personnel
                                    provided the details on the process and products involved,
                                    as well as the guidelines to be adhered to.</li>
                                <li>Benchmarking of the processes and the guidelines for a successful process resolution
                                    was undertaken.</li>
                                <li>Identification of technology platform to be used for resoution -
                                    ORACLE and Developer 2000 Forms 5</li>
                                <li>The new automated technology eliminated manual intervention completely and captured the
                                    data real time with the help of Korean Sensors installed in the steel caster injectors
                                    to report back, casting composition on a real time basis.
                                    This information arrived using the ORACLE 'C' interface as - C structures
                                    and was captured and stored into the central ORACLE database repository
                                    for future use by Quality Assurance personnel in the form of formatted reports
                                    designed to their suitability.</li>
